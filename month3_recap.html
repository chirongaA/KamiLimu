      <p>In this month, things really started to heat up, like seriously!!üò≠.</p>
      <p>The ICT sessions started with a bang having a total of 4 sessions in Month 3. In addition to that, we also got a taste of interview preparation sessions. This was probably the most fruitful of them all as the first session contributed to me getting an offer of attachment after I aced the interview.</p>
      <p>However, progress became harder and harder, as I had to juggle between preparing for exams and maitaining progress in the sessions. The stress hit fever pitch as rejection after rejection emails flooded my inbox. So here we have KamiLimu, CATs and Exams and add projects if you wish, application rejections and a constant dread of the following day‚Ä¶</p>

    <p class="mb-6 text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
      Month 3 was more than just a month of learning ‚Äî it was a mirror. A mirror that showed me grit isn't just a fancy word in a book; it's a lifestyle. Between deadlines, interviews, and rejections, I began to understand what it means to pursue academic excellence not as a goal, but as a mindset. I embraced feedback with less fear, applied new learning techniques like chunking and retrieval practice, and stopped confusing being busy with being effective. I'm not just studying to pass; I'm studying to grow.

    <h3 class="text-2xl  text-center italic mb-2">A Problem Worth Solving</h3>
    <div class="bg-gradient-to-r from-cyan-100 to-gray-200 p-6 rounded-lg shadow">
      <p class="italic whitespace-pre-line text-center text-gray-800">
Innovation starts not with tech,
But questions we ask when things seem a wreck.

A problem worth solving is clear and real,
It touches a nerve, it's something you feel.

KamiLimu stands as proof to this,
Filling gaps the system might miss.

It's relevant, useful, friendly, and wise,
A scalable answer in Kenya's rise.

Observe, explore, define and reflect,
Ask the five whys, be sharp and direct.

Not every fix is worth your stake,
But some are so vital, they keep us awake.

So seek those problems that make us care,
Where impact is real‚Äîand solutions
are rare.
