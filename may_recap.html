      <p>In this month, things really started to heat up, like seriously!!üò≠.</p>
      <p>The ICT sessions started with a bang having a total of 3 sessions in May. In addition to that, we also got a taste of scholarship writing, something Dr. C is very passionate about, having experienced what it means to get scholarships to school abroad and also reviewing scholarship essays for KamiLimu alumni.</p>
      <p>However, progress became harder and harder, as exams were drawing near. The stress hit fever pitch as rejection after rejection emails flooded my inbox. So here we have KamiLimu, CATs and Exams and add projects if you wish, application rejections and a constant dread of the following day‚Ä¶</p>

    <p class="mb-6 text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
      May was more than just a month of learning ‚Äî it was a mirror. A mirror that showed me grit isn't just a fancy word in a book; it's a lifestyle. Between deadlines, interviews, and rejections, I began to understand what it means to pursue academic excellence not as a goal, but as a mindset. I embraced feedback with less fear, applied new learning techniques like chunking and retrieval practice, and stopped confusing being busy with being effective. I'm not just studying to pass; I'm studying to grow.
    </p>
    <h3 class="text-2xl  text-center italic mb-2">A Poetic Nod to Academic Excellence</h3>
    <div class="bg-gradient-to-r from-cyan-100 to-gray-200 p-6 rounded-lg shadow">
      <p class="italic whitespace-pre-line text-center text-gray-800">
A good education? It's more than a class,
It's grit, it‚Äôs feedback, not just a pass.

It‚Äôs mentors who care, and lessons that stick,
It‚Äôs scaffolds and questions, not cramming quick.

It‚Äôs chunking ideas into manageable bits,
Retrieval that strengthens, not last-minute fits.

Holistic and human, it challenges norms,
In excellence‚Äôs fire, true learning forms.

Feedback‚Äôs not fury‚Äîit‚Äôs mirrors that show,
How better we can be, how further we‚Äôll go.

So here‚Äôs to the struggle, the effort, the try,
To lifelong learning‚Äîwe reach for the sky!
